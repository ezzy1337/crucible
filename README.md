# Crucible
Crucible is an open-source python stress testing service for RESTful API's. The routes, actions and
responses used to test and verify an API are read in from the target API's OpenAPIv3 spec making
Crucible easily configurable, and reusable.

## Roadmap
 [] Support stress testing GET actions.
 [] Support validating response body schema.
 [] Support stress testing POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE actions.
 [] Support OAUth2.0 protected API's.
